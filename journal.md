1. In week 32 we created a video summarising all our work from the year. All we have learned and what we have taken away from learning this year in the second semester of the info science. I wrote a script for this video, the link is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJVyw9IWjVwl3UX1xGjkEEURuXusJyB3z0-b2N8DWb8/edit?usp=sharing and through making this script, I actually realised the amount I have learned in this short span of time.

2. How to create a screen recording using QuickTime player on mac.


3. No questions this week
