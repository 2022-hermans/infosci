1. What did we do
2. What did I learn
3. What questions do I have

1. We watched a video on computational thinking and instructed a operator step by step on how to make a Jam sandwich.
2. Today we learned about the basics of computational thinking as the 4 steps are; Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction and Algorith Design. Decomposition is breaking down your issue into the main components, Pattern Recognition is using your experience to help you solve or understand the issue, Abstraction is getting rid of obstacles that are present but don't effect the problem and Algorithm Design is creating a procedure to solving the issue. We put this into practice during the Jelly expirement explained above.
3. What are the different options of proccessing we will be learning this year?
