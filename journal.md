1. Today in week 33 we looked at Ceasars Cipher and when he used it in addition to looking at the Cicada scavenger hunt. Cicada 3301 is quite a mystery therefore I really enjoyed that part. Dr Ruben also gave us a message in Ceasars Cipher and we had to decipher it using what we learned.

2. This week I learned quite a bit about Ceasars Cipher, how cipher and decipher using Ceasars' method. I also learned about the Cicada scavenger hunt, its mysteries, the processes and the clues used. I learned how these individuals managed to crack the codes given to them by Cicada 3301.

3. Who is Cicada? What do they do? Where are they? Have they impacted my life without me knowing?
